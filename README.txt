Real-Time Sales Ticker for WooCommerce

== Description ==

Display real-time WooCommerce sales numbers as a ticker across the top of your WordPress admin or site. 

This plugin makes it easier to display web store sales to execs or other team members that do not have the need or desire to log into WordPress to check them. 
It allows you to whitelist specific IP addresses, which will be able to see the real-time sales at the top of the WooCommerce site without needing to log in!
